Introduction
############


|short_description|


This file was created using Sphinx. To modify it you'll need to change the
following files:

- Makefile
- conf.py
- index.rst
- report_pipeline_pq_example.rst
- report_substitution_vars.rst

Makefile makes it easier to invoke sphinx commands.

conf.py is the Sphinx configuration file, modify it to configure all aspects of how Sphinx reads and builds.

index.rst doesn't do much here as only one file is being used.
You can include other rst files though. See the toctree_ directive for its use.

In report_substitution_vars.rst you can change some of the text that gets
automatically replaced. Again, not particularly helpful here as we're only
using them once. 

See the `Sphinx tutorial`_ to get a better idea of what's happening.

The file pipeline_pq_example.ini comes in this folder and is used for running the scripts in a
pipeline, instead of one at a time. See CGAT_ for more on this.

Feel free to play around with the example, change script parameters, what plots
are included in the report, etc. To start again just run:

.. code-block:: bash

   project_quickstart --example

to make a new copy of the original example scripts.

Results
#######

In the following sections I've pulled in some plots and tables that were
created when running the example scripts. Note that the scripts have more
options and generate more results than those here.

The purpose is simply to show how you can include results and text in a report
which can then be converted to html or pdf and updated with little intervention
(if scripts are re-run with different parameters, a new dataset is added,
etc.).


Note that if you didn't change the ini file, you will get results that have
files with names 'my_dataframe' and 'pandas_DF_from_INI'.

In this report I've only included some results from the mtcars dataset examples
and 'my_dataframe' files. 

'my_dataframe' and 'pandas_DF_from_INI' are dataframes from random variables that
are generated by an initial script. Other scripts take these data for plotting,
making regressions, tables, etc. 

Note that if you generated this with a pipeline command, you can create an
arbitrary number of simulated dataframes simply by adding names to the ini
file. The dataframes will look very similar as the simulations are constrained. See
the script::

   ../code/pq_example/pq_example.py

for more details.


Some figures
============

In the raw reStructuredText file the image directive would
like::

  .. figure:: ../F1_mtcars.*

     This is from "../F1_mtcars.*"

     You can add a legend here.

and produce the following:


.. figure:: ../F1_mtcars.*

    This is from "../F1_mtcars.*"

    You can add a legend here.


Or::

  .. figure:: ../F1_mtcars.*
     :height: 300
     :width: 500
     :scale: 75
     :alt: A multi-panel plot from the R dataset mtcars


.. figure:: ../F2_mtcars.*
   :height: 300
   :width: 300
   :scale: 75
   :alt: A multi-panel plot from the R dataset mtcars



And::

  .. figure:: ../F2_mtcars.*
     :align: center

     This is a multi-panel plot from the file F2_mtcars.*


.. figure:: ../F2_mtcars.*
   :align: center

   This is a multi-panel plot from the file F2_mtcars.*


.. figure:: ../F1_my_dataframe.*
   :align: center

   These are python matplotlib plots.

   The legend follows the empty line after the caption.


You can see the `image directive`_ for details.

-----


PDF files can also be included e.g. :download:`F1_mtcars.pdf <../F1_mtcars.pdf>`
but they'll only be available in html outputs.

To hide it in PDFs, use::

  .. only:: builder_html

     See :download:`this example script <../example.py>`.

You can see more information on this here_.

.. _here: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/inline.html#referencing-downloadable-files


Some tables
============

To output tables as csv or tsv you can use::

   .. csv-table::
   :file: ../desc_stats_my_dataframe.tsv
   :delim: tab

to embed results in either html or pdf output:

.. csv-table::
   :file: ../desc_stats_my_dataframe.tsv
   :delim: tab


If you have html or tex files you can use the raw directive as a workaround.
Best not abused though. The :file: option may represent a security risk.
You'll need to use both html and latex files for their corresponding outputs. 

Note that for PDFs floating in latex (i.e. controlling where figures and tables will
appear) can be hard to control. See the raw version of this file, conf.py for latex options and `this webpage`_
for some information.

.. raw:: latex
   :file: ../my_dataframe_lm_table.tex

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../my_dataframe_lm_table.html



.. raw:: latex
   :file: ../mtcars_lm_table.tex

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../mtcars_lm_table.html
